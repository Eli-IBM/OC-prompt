--all=false: Delete all resources, in the namespace of the specified resource types.
-A: If present, list the requested object(s) across all namespaces. Namespace in current context is ignored even if specified with --namespace.
--all-namespaces=false: If present, list the requested object(s) across all namespaces. Namespace in current context is ignored even if specified with --namespace.
--cascade='background': Must be 'background', 'orphan', or 'foreground'. Selects the deletion cascading strategy for the dependents (e.g. Pods created by a ReplicationController). Defaults to background.
--dry-run='none': Must be 'none', 'server', or 'client'. If client strategy, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it. If server strategy, submit server-side request without persisting the resource.
--field-selector='': Selector (field query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. --field-selector key1=value1,key2=value2). The server only supports a limited number of field queries per type.
-f: containing the resource to delete.
--filename=[]: containing the resource to delete.
--force=false: If true, immediately remove resources from API and bypass graceful deletion. Note that immediate deletion of some resources may result in inconsistency or data loss and requires confirmation.
--grace-period=-1: Period of time in seconds given to the resource to terminate gracefully. Ignored if negative. Set to 1 for immediate shutdown. Can only be set to 0 when --force is true (force deletion).
--ignore-not-found=false: Treat 'resource not found' as a successful delete. Defaults to 'true' when --all is specified.
-k: Process a kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.
--kustomize='': Process a kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.
--now=false: If true, resources are signaled for immediate shutdown (same as --grace-period=1).
-o: Output mode. Use '-o name' for shorter output (resource/name).
--output='': Output mode. Use '-o name' for shorter output (resource/name).
--raw='': Raw URI to DELETE to the server.  Uses the transport specified by the kubeconfig file.
-R: Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
--recursive=false: Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
-l: Selector (label query) to filter on.
--selector='': Selector (label query) to filter on.
--timeout=0s: The length of time to wait before giving up on a delete, zero means determine a timeout from the size of the object
--wait=true: If true, wait for resources to be gone before returning. This waits for finalizers.
