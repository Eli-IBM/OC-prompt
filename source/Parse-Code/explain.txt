List the fields for supported resources.

 This command describes the fields associated with each supported API resource. Fields are identified via a simple JSONPath identifier:

<type> .<fieldName> [.<fieldName> ]

 Add the --recursive flag to display all of the fields at once without descriptions. Information about each field is retrieved from the server in OpenAPI format.

 Use "oc api-resources" for a complete list of supported resources.

Usage:
  oc explain RESOURCE [flags]

Examples:
  # Get the documentation of the resource and its fields
  oc explain pods
  
  # Get the documentation of a specific field of a resource
  oc explain pods.spec.containers

Options:
      --api-version='': Get different explanations for particular API version (API group/version)
      --recursive=false: Print the fields of fields (Currently only 1 level deep)

Use "oc options" for a list of global command-line options (applies to all commands).
