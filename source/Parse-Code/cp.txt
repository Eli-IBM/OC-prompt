Copy files and directories to and from containers.

Usage:
  oc cp <file-spec-src> <file-spec-dest> [flags]

Examples:
  # !!!Important Note!!!
  # Requires that the 'tar' binary is present in your container
  # image.  If 'tar' is not present, 'oc cp' will fail.
  #
  # For advanced use cases, such as symlinks, wildcard expansion or
  # file mode preservation, consider using 'oc exec'.
  
  # Copy /tmp/foo local file to /tmp/bar in a remote pod in namespace <some-namespace>
  tar cf - /tmp/foo | oc exec -i -n <some-namespace> <some-pod> -- tar xf - -C /tmp/bar
  
  # Copy /tmp/foo from a remote pod to /tmp/bar locally
  oc exec -n <some-namespace> <some-pod> -- tar cf - /tmp/foo | tar xf - -C /tmp/bar
  
  # Copy /tmp/foo_dir local directory to /tmp/bar_dir in a remote pod in the default namespace
  oc cp /tmp/foo_dir <some-pod>:/tmp/bar_dir
  
  # Copy /tmp/foo local file to /tmp/bar in a remote pod in a specific container
  oc cp /tmp/foo <some-pod>:/tmp/bar -c <specific-container>
  
  # Copy /tmp/foo local file to /tmp/bar in a remote pod in namespace <some-namespace>
  oc cp /tmp/foo <some-namespace>/<some-pod>:/tmp/bar
  
  # Copy /tmp/foo from a remote pod to /tmp/bar locally
  oc cp <some-namespace>/<some-pod>:/tmp/foo /tmp/bar

Options:
  -c, --container='': Container name. If omitted, use the kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-container annotation for selecting the container to be attached or the first container in the pod will be chosen
      --no-preserve=false: The copied file/directory's ownership and permissions will not be preserved in the container
      --retries=0: Set number of retries to complete a copy operation from a container. Specify 0 to disable or any negative value for infinite retrying. The default is 0 (no retry).

Use "oc options" for a list of global command-line options (applies to all commands).
