Revert an application back to a previous deployment.

 When you run this command, your deployment configuration will be updated to match a previous deployment. By default only the pod and container configuration will be changed and scaling or trigger settings will be left as- is. Note that environment variables and volumes are included in rollbacks, so if you've recently updated security credentials in your environment your previous deployment may not have the correct values.

 Any image triggers present in the rolled back configuration will be disabled with a warning. This is to help prevent your rolled back deployment from being replaced by a triggered deployment soon after your rollback. To re-enable the triggers, use the 'set triggers' command.

 If you want to review the outcome of the rollback, pass '--dry-run' to print a human-readable representation of the updated deployment configuration instead of executing the rollback. This is useful if you're not sure what the outcome will be.

Usage:
  oc rollback (DEPLOYMENTCONFIG | DEPLOYMENT) [flags]

Examples:
  # Perform a rollback to the last successfully completed deployment for a deployment config
  oc rollback frontend
  
  # See what a rollback to version 3 will look like, but do not perform the rollback
  oc rollback frontend --to-version=3 --dry-run
  
  # Perform a rollback to a specific deployment
  oc rollback frontend-2
  
  # Perform the rollback manually by piping the JSON of the new config back to oc
  oc rollback frontend -o json | oc replace dc/frontend -f -
  
  # Print the updated deployment configuration in JSON format instead of performing the rollback
  oc rollback frontend -o json

Options:
      --allow-missing-template-keys=true: If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.
      --change-scaling-settings=false: If true, include the previous deployment's replicationController replica count and selector in the rollback
      --change-strategy=false: If true, include the previous deployment's strategy in the rollback
      --change-triggers=false: If true, include the previous deployment's triggers in the rollback
  -d, --dry-run=false: Instead of performing the rollback, describe what the rollback will look like in human-readable form
  -o, --output='': Output format. One of: json|yaml|name|go-template|go-template-file|template|templatefile|jsonpath|jsonpath-as-json|jsonpath-file.
      --show-managed-fields=false: If true, keep the managedFields when printing objects in JSON or YAML format.
      --template='': Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
      --to-version=0: A config version to rollback to. Specifying version 0 is the same as omitting a version (the version will be auto-detected). This option is ignored when specifying a deployment.

Use "oc options" for a list of global command-line options (applies to all commands).
