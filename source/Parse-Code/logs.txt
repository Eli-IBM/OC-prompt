Print the logs for a resource.

 Supported resources are builds, build configs (bc), deployment configs (dc), and pods. When a pod is specified and has more than one container, the container name should be specified via -c. When a build config or deployment config is specified, you can view the logs for a particular version of it via --version.

 If your pod is failing to start, you may need to use the --previous option to see the logs of the last attempt.

Usage:
  oc logs [-f] [-p] (POD | TYPE/NAME) [-c CONTAINER] [flags]

Examples:
  # Start streaming the logs of the most recent build of the openldap build config
  oc logs -f bc/openldap
  
  # Start streaming the logs of the latest deployment of the mysql deployment config
  oc logs -f dc/mysql
  
  # Get the logs of the first deployment for the mysql deployment config. Note that logs
  # from older deployments may not exist either because the deployment was successful
  # or due to deployment pruning or manual deletion of the deployment
  oc logs --version=1 dc/mysql
  
  # Return a snapshot of ruby-container logs from pod backend
  oc logs backend -c ruby-container
  
  # Start streaming of ruby-container logs from pod backend
  oc logs -f pod/backend -c ruby-container

Options:
      --all-containers=false: Get all containers' logs in the pod(s).
  -c, --container='': Print the logs of this container
  -f, --follow=false: Specify if the logs should be streamed.
      --ignore-errors=false: If watching / following pod logs, allow for any errors that occur to be non-fatal
      --insecure-skip-tls-verify-backend=false: Skip verifying the identity of the kubelet that logs are requested from.  In theory, an attacker could provide invalid log content back. You might want to use this if your kubelet serving certificates have expired.
      --limit-bytes=0: Maximum bytes of logs to return. Defaults to no limit.
      --max-log-requests=5: Specify maximum number of concurrent logs to follow when using by a selector. Defaults to 5.
      --pod-running-timeout=20s: The length of time (like 5s, 2m, or 3h, higher than zero) to wait until at least one pod is running
      --prefix=false: Prefix each log line with the log source (pod name and container name)
  -p, --previous=false: If true, print the logs for the previous instance of the container in a pod if it exists.
  -l, --selector='': Selector (label query) to filter on.
      --since=0s: Only return logs newer than a relative duration like 5s, 2m, or 3h. Defaults to all logs. Only one of since-time / since may be used.
      --since-time='': Only return logs after a specific date (RFC3339). Defaults to all logs. Only one of since-time / since may be used.
      --tail=-1: Lines of recent log file to display. Defaults to -1 with no selector, showing all log lines otherwise 10, if a selector is provided.
      --timestamps=false: Include timestamps on each line in the log output
      --version=0: View the logs of a particular build or deployment by version if greater than zero
