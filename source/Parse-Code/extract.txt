Extract files out of secrets and config maps.

 The extract command makes it easy to download the contents of a config map or secret into a directory. Each key in the config map or secret is created as a separate file with the name of the key, as it is when you mount a secret or config map into a container.

 You may extract the contents of a secret or config map to standard out by passing '-' to the --to option. The names of each key will be written to standard error.

 You can limit which keys are extracted with the --keys=NAME flag, or set the directory to extract to with --to=DIRECTORY.

Usage:
  oc extract RESOURCE/NAME [--to=DIRECTORY] [--keys=KEY ...] [flags]

Examples:
  # Extract the secret "test" to the current directory
  oc extract secret/test
  
  # Extract the config map "nginx" to the /tmp directory
  oc extract configmap/nginx --to=/tmp
  
  # Extract the config map "nginx" to STDOUT
  oc extract configmap/nginx --to=-
  
  # Extract only the key "nginx.conf" from config map "nginx" to the /tmp directory
  oc extract configmap/nginx --to=/tmp --keys=nginx.conf

Options:
      --confirm=false: If true, overwrite files that already exist.
  -f, --filename=[]: Filename, directory, or URL to file to identify to extract the resource.
      --keys=[]: An optional list of keys to extract (default is all keys).
      --to='.': Directory to extract files to.

Use "oc options" for a list of global command-line options (applies to all commands).
